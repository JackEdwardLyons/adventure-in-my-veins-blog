Life on the road as a climber certainly has it's charms. I mean, how can you resist being out in nature, surrounded by beautiful mountains, alongside newfound climbing buddies all while pushing oneself to the limit on a newly discovered project? 

Sounds too good to be true right? Most climbers think it can only be done if you're willing to give up everything in order to get by, ala "dirtbagging". Well, I'm here today with an amazing climber, and "digital dirtbag", who is walking proof that it doesn't have to be.

Duncan Brown is the founder of [**Athlete by Choice**](https://www.athletebychoice.com/), Duncan is the epitome of what it really means to be a “Digital Dirtbag”. Without risking it all he has cleverly crafted a life and a living around his love for climbing as well as his passion for health, fitness, personal development and of course, travel.

In this interview, Duncan shows us that location independence truly is possible and that there's never been a better time to learn a digital trade. It’s now possible for anyone to freely pick up freelance jobs, new clients and build a business via an internet connection and a Skype account. But of course, professionalism, expertise and dedication to one’s craft definitely play a critical role to cultivating success, as you’ll soon see.

At the end of the day what remains clear is that it truly is possible to design a life of location independence, engaging work, exciting projects, and adventures across the globe.

**_Q: Tell us a little about yourself (your work, life, how you spend your time) and especially, how you got into climbing?_**

**__**

Like a lot of kids I was always climbing all over things, up trees, onto roofs and all that jazz, then I did some indoor rock climbing a few times in high school but I didn’t get into the sport at that point. I was a very outdoors sort of kid and went fishing and camping and hiking a lot but never really knew about outdoor climbing. Then after high school I was studying Geoscience and a class mate was a climber and I got introduced to it then at about 19 years of age.



I was hooked immediately, as a lot of us are. I climbed daily at the local gym and soon went outdoors. My first day outdoors was seconding a 2 pitch Henry Barber 5.11b called ‘Soolaimon’ and then onsighting an Andrew Bull 5.10d sport route called ‘Intergalactic Bugs’ – needless to say, from that day on I could not get enough of climbing in the outdoors!



Since that day climbing has been an integral part of my life (apart from a brief hiatus when I was pursuing music production full time for a bit, but that’s a whole other story!). Climbing has dictated most of my choices of where to live and what to do for a living.



From moving to the Blue Mountains in Australia to spending numerous years living in Yangshuo in China. I have tended to gravitate towards places that offer both a plethora of climbing opportunity as well as the potential for employment.



I had spent quite some time working as a coach in climbing gyms, and as a swimming and gymnastics coach and a personal trainer, then with the internet becoming more and more a part of our every day lives I had the idea of trying to meld my love of teaching and coaching climbing with the digital age to try and provide an online climbing coaching service.



Since it’s beginnings as a blog, Athlete By Choice has developed into a lot more now with the cornerstone of what I do being individually tailored climbing training and coaching solutions delivered through a free and easy to use App and website that means you can train anywhere in the world and have me along for the ride laying out your program, coaching you and helping you to maximise your training time and achieve your goals.



This isn’t restricted to climbing, of course. I work with climbers (of all types, from boulderers to mountaineers) as well as skiers, mountain bikers, trail runners and more.



Being able to work on building a business that is both location independent as well as rewarding (in that I get to help people achieve their dreams and goals in the outdoors) has been amazing and while the business has a lot of room for growth yet, being able to integrate my passion and work into my climbing and travel rich lifestyle has been an amazing journey and I hope it can continue to grow and evolve for many years yet!
