  Meghan Kahnle shows us how to design a life around passion, purpose and
  people.

> I am a world traveler, trained graphic designer, painter, rock climber, and passionate community-oriented person. The goal of my work is to magically combine all of those things. I also want to thank those communities and people who make my life so full and diverse by giving back to them. Those who breathe love, support, and the pay-it-forward mentality are the backbone of my purpose. – Meghan Kahnle



I really do admire Meg’s passion and believe in her mission:

To be able to find purpose, build relationships within the community and spend one’s time pursuing creative projects that blend seamlessly around the mountains sounds like a pretty damn good way to live life if you ask me.

And best of all, Meg’s art is focused on giving back to the climbing community and the beautiful mountain landscapes which provide her with so much joy in life.

Find out in this interview how Meg experiments with art and follows her heart in order to design a Digital Dirtbag life that keeps her healthy, happy and on track to achieving her life goals.

**_Q: Tell us a little about yourself, where you’re from, how you got into climbing, and more specifically what has drawn you into this lifestyle?_**

Oh man I think I was born a travel bug with a paintbrush! After the age of 7 we moved about every two years, and no I wasn’t military. My parents worked in the forestry industry, so I’ve always had very close ties to the forest, and everything related to the wilderness.

With all the travelling from a young age I found my greatest escape and companion besides my brother was the outdoors. I documented all of my adventures typically in the medium of journalling and painting.

Because of my connection to the outdoors, getting into climbing was the next natural progression of outdoor adventure and enjoyment for me. I started by scrambling and playing on boulders with friends, and then found a great community when I started university to study art and design. I worked at the climbing gym, went on trips with my co-workers, did homework from my sleeping bag and loved every second of my time at Oregon State University.

**After I graduated I was the only one from my degree that was refusing to look for a job and join the “big girl” world.** I was going to travel abroad, work on farms, sleep wherever I got tired, and climb and dance everywhere I went. Which is exactly what happened.

> I was gone for 400 days, lived out of 90 litres of space, travelled over 60,500 km through 18 countries, and climbed and danced Argentine tango in 11 of them.

It was an amazing adventure and I did my best to document in the moment, but it wasn’t until I got back stateside and settled that I was truly able to reminisce and pay tribute to my travels.

The 4-foot by 8 foot mixed-media painting I did about my travels around the world was the turning point for me in my quest to become a digital dirtbag. **When I was working on the painting I would lose track of time, and just melt into the process and the act of creating**. It felt so good, so freeing and so similar to how I feel climbing and being outside.

Currently I feel like I have one foot in the “big girl” world and one foot in dirtbag world. I have a job as the Associate Web-Designer at [**Bodybuilding.com** ](https://www.bodybuilding.com)which allows me flexible hours based on merit. So if I work my butt off, I get more time off. Which means sleeping in my car, and lots of travelling and climbing. I also like working for a company that practices what it preaches and places a priority on fitness and health.

It’s hard to juggle both lives sometimes though. I have to explain how I got such horrendous rope burns and bruises to the people in my office and I have to explain to climbers that body building is not all about taking steroids and stepping on stage with fake tans and speedos.

Okay that part isn’t hard it’s more funny, but the balancing act of switching gears between my separate lives is occasionally cumbersome albeit totally worth it!

_Q: What digital/creative projects are you currently working on and what does your vision (the bigger picture) really look like?_

__

The biggest project I’m working on right now is my [**\#ConnectWithSmithRock**](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/connectwithsmithrock/) project that is part of the Live Your Dream Grant I received from the [**American Alpine Club**](http://americanalpineclub.org/home) this year. My mission with all of my work is to create collaborative mixed-media art projects to inspire, inform and give back to the communities that help create them.

With the Smith Rock project I’m collecting images from the surrounding Smith Rock community through email, Instagram (using the hashtag #ConnectWithSmithRock) and Facebook to create another 4-foot by 8-foot triptych painting.

The painting will have a collage of all the images I collect, and then two more transparent layers of one big image of Smith Rock sculpted and painted over top. The piece will be finished by the end of the year and then hang at Red Point, the local gear store at Smith Rock, for 4 months before it is sold, having **100% of the profits go back to the park.**

I like being able to tell a story with my work. I’ve done wedding commissions, commemorative pieces of pets, and with the Smith Rock piece I really want to tell the full story of the park, because both the people and the place are important in my opinion.

And my vision, well I suppose I’d really like to do more work like this. I would love to travel full-time and work with more communities and parks that want to connect with and engage the public in diverse ways. I want to collaborate on creative artistic fund raisers and outreach missions.

> I want to be able to raise funds, promote awareness, and give a different sort of voice to those causes and those people that are making an effort to do positive things.

And to be completely honest and a bit vulnerable here… **I am genuinely so stoked and overwhelmingly passionate about this idea and this work because I know this is what I am supposed to be doing**. I feel in my bones and my heart that I might actually be able to make a difference with this set of tools and skills I have, and it makes me burst with excitement and talk in a super excited speedy voice sometimes. Haha not sure if that’s apparent in type 😀.
