            How many times have you saved all your cash for an epic overseas holiday, 
            had an AMAZING time, only to come home broke and bummed out without any 
            idea how you're going to do it again?
          </p>
          <p>
            For years I thought that was just how life was going to be: 
            work, save, travel ... work, save, travel ... üòï ... And then what!? 
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong><em>This style of travel isn't sustainable</em></strong>. 
            Working dead-end jobs just to save some cash-for-travel won't get 
            you very far - sure it works - but for how long? This way of life 
            sure aint gonna get easier as you get older.
          </p>

            <strong><em>What if you could travel (climb) around the world on your own terms?</em></strong><br> 
            Imagine working your own hours online as a freelancer, or selling products from your 
            online shop. You could live minutes from a world-class crag in Thailand, China, Greece or Spain,
            where a months rent could easily be made in a single working day! I call this <strong><em>Digital Dirtbagging</em></strong>.
